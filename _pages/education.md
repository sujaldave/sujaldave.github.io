## University of Calgary, Canada
### PhD, Mechanical Engineering (GPA:4.0/4.0)
_May 2021 - June 2025_

* Advisor: Dr. Artem Korobenko
* Advancing the in-house wind turbine simulation tool for faster and accurate wind farm simulations using ALM for environmental flows. Investigating the role of atmospheric stratification on wind turbine wake in different layouts.
* Developed and integrated projection-based reduced-order modeling utility for in-house fluid flow solver written using FORTRAN and OpenMPI for turbulent flow simulations. Developing neural network based efficiency enhancement for reduced order models using PyTorch and Tensorflow. Exploring non-intrusive techniques like DMD and PINNs.
* Consistent use of HPC clusters available locally (ARC UCalgary) and nationally (Digital Research Alliance of Canada) to run simulations ranging from few thousand elements to couple million elements. Employed remote visualization techniques.
* Utilized a range of specialized software tools, including ANSA and Rhino for complex meshing, VisIt and ParaView for CFD post-processing and MATLAB and Python for data analysis.
