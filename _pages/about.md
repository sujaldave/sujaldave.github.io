I am a PhD candidate at the University of Calgary and a member of [CFSM Lab](https://www.cfsmgroup.com/). My research mainly focuses on computational fluid dynamics (CFD), turbulence modeling, reduced order modeling (ROM) and machine learning for CFD. I am currently developing an in-house finite element method (FEM) based CFD solver for reducing the dimensionality and computational costs of simulating environmental flows typically for wind turbine and wind farm modeling.
