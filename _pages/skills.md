### **CFD Simulation Tools**

**OpenFOAM**                

🟩 🟩 🟩 🟩 🟩

* Merged various OpenFOAM flow & particle solvers to track the uptake of dissolved drug particles from the nasal regions to the body. Check out my [M.S. (Thesis)](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/resolver/1840.20/38473).

* Taught OpenFOAM as a part of the CFD (ENME 572/672) course to undergraduate and graduate students during my teaching assistantships at University of Calgary.

**ANSYS-Fluent**            

🟩 🟩 🟩 🟩 🟥

* Continuously honing my skills with the ANSYS simulation software for flow solution since my undergraduate days when I accomplished my first CFD simulation of a centrifugal compressor using ANSYS-Fluent.

* Taught ANSYS-Fluent as a part of the Aerodynamics (ENME 570/670) course to undergraduate and graduate students during my teaching assistantships at University of Calgary.


### **CFD Pre-Processing Tools**

**ANSA**                    

🟩 🟩 🟩 🟩 🟩

* Generated over 100+ CFD meshes to simulate the flow over canonical and complex domians.

* Completed "Introduction to CFD Pre- & Post-Processing with ANSA/META" training course by Beta CAE Systems (Online).

* Taught ANSA topology, 2D meshing and 3D meshing modules as a part of CFD (ENME 572/672) and FEM (ENME 547) courses to undergraduate and graduate students during my teaching assistantships at University of Calgary.

**ANSYS ICEM**              

🟩 🟩 🟥 🟥 🟥

* Generated meshes for complex internal structures of the human nasal cavity and the lung geometry. Created meshes for the trachea, alveoli and nasal geometry from MRI scans of patient-specific data. 

**GMSH**                    

🟩 🟩 🟩 🟥 🟥

* Utilized the free mesh generation software to automate mesh creation of 50 geometries to simulate flow over different configuration of backward-facing step geometry. The slope of the step was parameterized using two coefficients that were varied to generate training data for the DeepONet to learn from. Check out my work [here](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=zRef200Ucc).

**VisIt**                   

🟩 🟩 🟩 🟩 🟩

* Proficient with visualizing the CFD results by generating the contours, isovolumes and various user-defined functions to present the results.

* Taught VisIt as a part of CFD (ENME 572/672) and FEM (ENME 547) courses to undergraduate and graduate students during my teaching assistantships at University of Calgary.

**ParaView**               

🟩 🟩 🟩 🟩 🟩

* Utilized the python-scripting functions and remote visualization techniques in ParaView to regularly render the CFD results from HPC clusters on the local machine.

* Proficient in visualizing the CFD results and generate excellent plots and videos to use in publications and conference presentations.
